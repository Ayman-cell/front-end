# Penalty System Guide

## Overview
The penalty system allows you to subtract points from a team's score during a race. Each penalty is applied as negative points and affects the final race time ranking.

## How It Works

### During Race
1. **View Penalties**: Each team timer card displays "Penalty: X" in red if penalties have been applied
2. **Add Penalties**: Two buttons are available for each team:
   - **-5 button (orange)**: Subtracts 5 points from the team
   - **-10 button (red)**: Subtracts 10 points from the team

### Penalty Calculation
- Each penalty point = 100 centiseconds added to final time
- Example: -5 penalty = +500 centiseconds to final time
- Formula: **Final Time = Actual Time + (Penalty × 100 centiseconds)**

### In Race Leaderboard
1. **Ranking Considers Penalties**: Teams are ranked by final time (including penalty)
2. **Penalty Display**:
   - Shows original time
   - Shows penalty amount in orange
   - Displays final adjusted time
3. **ALL PARTICIPANTS Section**: Shows penalty for each team

## Example Scenario

### Without Penalty
- Team A finishes in 01:23:45 (5045 centiseconds)
- Team A ranks #1

### With -5 Penalty
- Team A finishes in 01:23:45
- Team A receives -5 penalty
- Penalty adds: 5 × 100 = 500 centiseconds
- Final time: 01:28:45 (5545 centiseconds)
- Team A may drop in ranking if other teams are faster

## Use Cases
- Equipment failure or damage: -5 or -10
- Rule violation: -5 or -10
- Incomplete task: -10
- Safety infraction: -10

## Notes
- Penalties can be applied multiple times (buttons can be clicked multiple times)
- Penalties are displayed in the race history leaderboard
- Penalties only affect rankings, not the actual stopwatch time
